# Napoleonic Infantry Tactics

This React-basd website explores the battle tactics employed by Napoleon's Grand Armee during the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) that raged across Europe, from Spain to Russia. Utilizing AnimeJs to animate and position soldiers, the site's primary feature is to show the three most essential combat formations employed by one of Napoleon's battalions to respond to the highly dynamic nature of the early 19th Century battlefield. Additionally, a node-based backend connected to a MongoDB database provide relevant quotes from the era upon page refresh.

## Features

Here's a screenshot of the full web app, featuring the default formation of the Battle Line.

The square formation is shown below. Generating the formations was made possible by writing a function that required the height and width in soldiers of the company and output the desired shape, all enabled with AnimeJS and React.
